                            I've spent a lot of time in the last couple of months 
                            on <a href="https://www.cars.com">Cars.com</a>
                            looking for a deal that would neither break my bank
                            nor have a high probability of becoming a headache in
                            a year - to no avail. I did some research and it looks
                            like prices might begin to decline sometime soon, although
                            no one can tell for certain.

                            So I asked myself: How long should I wait? Should I buy
                            a car that recently got listed or should I wait a bit 
                            before getting in touch, see if the price changes?
                            Are certain models getting cheaper than others? To answer
                            those questions I decided to build a Python script
                            that runs every night while I'm asleep. It scrapes
                            <a href="https://www.cars.com">Cars.com</a> for the
                            filters I selected and adds the details of the
                            cars it found onto a table in a csv file. From there,
                            I can read the file in Jupyter Notebooks whenever I want
                            and use Python to see what the prices of the cars I'm
                            after are doing.

                            I don't have much data yet, but I expect this tool to
                            become more powerful as time goes by. So far I have 
                            found that only around 10% of cars change price in a week,
                            and cars with higher mileages tend to drop in price 
                            faster than those with lower mileages.

                            For those who have never heard of it, 'Magic: The Gathering' (or MTG, for short) 
                            is the most played collectible cards game in the world, which begins to

                            I mean, he spends hours a day looking through the twenty thousand unique cards
                            on the market deciding which ones he will add to the next deck he's building. 
                            That does, as one might expect, come with some challenges.

                            Search tools are available to facilitate finding the right cards, but my cousin 
                            was having trouble with balancing out his decks. You see, MTG cards have a 'cost' 
                            that must be 'payed' by the player when they want to play it. If a deck only has 
                            high cost cards, it won't work properly. But the same goes for a deck that only 
                            has low cost cards. This is also true for other properties of the cards, such as 
                            their color, type, etc. And given that the decks my cousin builds are composed 
                            of 100 cards each, it becomes difficult to keep track.

                            This is where I saw an opportunity to help him out. I thought that it shouldn't be 
                            too hard write up a program that took in a list of cards in a deck and spit out a 
                            few useful graphs and numbers. My cousin is not very comfortable with tech, so I knew 
                            I would need a GUI. So I did some research and decided to use Tkinter, a Python package 
                            for creating GUIs in Python. I hooked up the GUI to a few functions, and using Pandas 
                            and Seaborn I was able to make it display graphs. My cousin has been using it, and
                            while he has some suggestions for improvement, I think it's been a success!

                            One of the most interesting courses I've taken at UCSD - COGS 138: Neural 
                            Data Science - was also one of the hardest to grasp. While I have quite a 
                            bit of background in neuroscience and in data science, analyzing EEG data 
                            is not an easy task.

                            For our project, my group of 5 decided to use a dataset from a study 
                            that was made available online. The study was interested in using music 
                            to change participants' affects, and using their EEG data to reverse-engineer 
                            this into an algorithm that could read people's affects from their EEG 
                            readings. We used some of their data for a different purpose - we wanted to 
                            see if we could find correlations between the features of the music being 
                            played to participants and artifacts in their EEG readings.

                            This project was challenging for many reasons. For starters, we had trouble 
                            downloading the data onto a platform we could all access and work with 
                            simultaneously. After dealing with that, the data we wanted to work with was 
                            nested and stored across several tables. Linking the EEG readings to the 
                            corresponding song being played was also a challenge. Once we finally got 
                            through all of that, we had to deal with the largest challenge of them all - 
                            how do you extract meaning from EEG data?

                            Luckily, we had a tenured professor of Cognitive Science there to help us, 
                            Prof. Bradley Voytek. He gave us tips on using MNE, a Python package designed 
                            specifically for this purpose, as well as other tools he designed himself in 
                            his lab. At the end of the course, we did not find any statistically relevant 
                            results but learned a lot from trying to.
